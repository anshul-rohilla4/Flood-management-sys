# Flood Monitoring System using AIOT
Floods present escalating challenges globally, underscoring the need for sophisticated monitoring frameworks. This paper introduces a Flood Monitoring System (FMS) harnessing Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) technologies. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cloud computing, and AI algorithms, the FMS delivers real-time monitoring, early warning capabilities, and decision-making supportcrucial for flood management.The core infrastructure of the FMS comprises IoT sensors strategically positioned to collect vital data such as water levels, rainfall intensity, and meteorological conditions. These sensors relay the gathered information to a cloud- based platform for robust analysis using AI algorithms. The AI algorithms process the data to predict flood events, discern patterns, and generate timely alerts for stakeholders.One of the significant advantages of the FMS is its ability to provide real- time data collection and analysis, ensuring that decision-makers are equipped with up- to-date information to respond effectively to evolving flood scenarios..Additionally the FMS features a customizable alerting system that notifies stakeholders through various channels such as SMS, email, or mobile applications, enabling swift response and mitigation measures. The system also offers intuitive data visualization tools and comprehensive reporting capabilities, facilitating risk assessment and informed decision-making.Overall, the implementation of this AIoT-based Flood Monitoring System represents a proactive approach to flood management, bolstering resilience and minimizing the adverse impacts of floods on communities and critical infrastructure
